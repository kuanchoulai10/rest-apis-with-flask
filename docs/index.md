# Build RESTful APIs with Flask

Welcome to the home page of my side project! This repository is a collection of work where I explore and build REST APIs using Flask, a lightweight and powerful Python web framework.

## About This Project

The goal of this project is to:
- Learn and experiment with Flask for building RESTful APIs.
- Understand best practices for API design and implementation.
- Explore integrations with databases, authentication, and other web technologies.

## Features

- **RESTful API Design**: Follows REST principles for clean and scalable APIs.
- **Flask Framework**: Built using Flask for simplicity and flexibility.
- **Database Integration**: Includes examples of working with databases like SQLite or SQLAlchemy.
- **Authentication**: Demonstrates how to secure APIs with authentication mechanisms.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling for better user experience.
