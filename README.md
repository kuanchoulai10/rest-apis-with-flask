# RESTful APIs with Flask

This repository documents my journey of learning how to build RESTful APIs using Flask. It includes step-by-step implementations of various concepts, from basic API design principles to advanced features like authentication, database integration, deployment, and third-party integrations. 

The content is based on two Udemy courses: "[REST APIs with Flask and Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/)" and "[Advanced REST APIs with Flask and Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-rest-apis-flask-python/)". Each section highlights key topics, tools, and techniques, making it a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to learn Flask for API development.
